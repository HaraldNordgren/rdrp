## rdrp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kshvmdn/rdrp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kshvmdn/rdrp)

> A cross-platform command line tool for sending and receiving files over your local network, inspired by [AirDrop](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204144).

### Demo

<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/120148"><img src="./rdrp.gif"></a>

### Design

rdrp uses [Multicast DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS) to enable peer-to-peer discovery between clients. This means that rdrp will likely **not** work in most cloud/virtual environments.

When a client first connects, they're registered as a new instance on the `_rdrp._tcp` service. Each sender continuously browses this service for newly connected broadcasters with whom they'll establish a connection and attempt to send their respective file.

This program implements mDNS with [grandcat/zeroconf](https://github.com/grandcat/zeroconf).

Read more about mDNS: [RFC 6762](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762) and DNS-SD: [RFC 6763](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763).

### Installation / setup

Go should be [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing).

Install with Go:

  ```sh
  $ go get -v github.com/kshvmdn/rdrp/...
  $ which rdrp
  $GOPATH/bin/rdrp
  ```

Or, install directly via source:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/kshvmdn/rdrp.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/kshvmdn/rdrp
  $ cd $_ # $GOPATH/src/github.com/kshvmdn/rdrp
  $ make install && make
  $ ./rdrp
  ```

### Usage

Run rdrp with `-help` to view the usage dialogue.

  ```sh
  $ rdrp -help
  Usage: rdrp [broadcast|list|send] [options]
  ```

There's two parties involved in a single transaction: the [sender](#sender) and the [receiver](#broadcaster).

#### Sender

To send a file, use the `send` command. Provide the file path with the `-file` flag OR pass the file's contents via stdin. Every broadcaster will receive a request to transfer the file (unless names are specified with the `-to` flag). This process continues until aborted (Ctrl+C).

  ```sh
  $ rdrp send -help
  Usage of send:
    -debug
        Show log output
    -file string
        File to transfer
    -name string
        Connection name
    -to value
        Comma-separated list of client names
  ```

##### Examples

```sh
$ rdrp send -file README.md
```

```sh
$ rdrp send -name sender < README.md
```

```sh
$ tar -cvzf archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory/
$ rdrp send -file archive.tar.gz -send-to a
```

```sh
$ echo "hello" | rdrp send -send-to b,c
```

#### Broadcaster

To broadcast yourself as a receiver (i.e. someone receiving a file), use the `broadcast` command. You'll be listening for incoming `send` requests. Upon a new connection, you'll be prompted on whether you'd like to accept the file or not, just like AirDrop. The incoming file is copied to stdout.

  ```sh
  $ rdrp broadcast -help
  Usage of broadcast:
  -debug
      Show log output
  -name string
      Connection name
  ```

##### Examples

  ```sh
  $ rdrp broadcast # output is copied to stdout
  ...
  ```

  ```sh
  $ rdrp -name b broadcast > archive.tar.gz
  ```

Note that each of the above roles has an **optional** name flag, if not provided, a name is chosen randomly (which is what happened in [the demo above](#demo)).

#### List

You can view all connected clients with `list`. Use `-type` to specify the type of clients to list and `-watch` to listen for new connections.

  ```
  $ rdrp list -help
  Usage of list:
  -debug
    	Show log output
  -type string
    	Type of client ("broadcast", "send", or "all") (default "all")
  -watch
    	Listen for new connections (use Ctrl+C to exit)
  ```

#### Use with Docker

Start off by cloning the repository (if you've already cloned, just make sure you're in the project root):

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/kshvmdn/rdrp
  $ cd rdrp
  ```

Build the Docker image:

  ```sh
  $ docker build -t kshvmdn/rdrp .
  ```

And run it! The `--rm` flag automatically removes the container when the program exits.

  ```sh
  $ docker run --rm kshvmdn/rdrp [broadcast|list|send] ...
  ```

#### TODO

- [ ] Add `-private` flag for sender/broadcaster to have "private" transfer (i.e. nobody can see that they're connected).
- [ ] The preliminary work for running this through Docker _is_ done, however it doesn't quite run completely. Each of the commands (broadcast, list, send) work fine and the clients _do_ find each other, however the transfers hang. I'm fairly certain that this is happening because the ports aren't being exposed in the container. I'm not sure if there's a way to fix this though, since the ports are randomly chosen on initialization. If anyone has a solution for this, I'd love to hear it!
- [ ] Check that the registration name is not already being used.
- [x] Add an option for senders to provide a list of names to send the file to (right now, when a file is sent, all connected clients get the prompt).
- [x] Add a `-list` flag to list all currently connected peers (this'll help with the previous TODO I think).
- [x] Add an option to send files via stdin.
- [x] Test. This is only tested on macOS right now, would be great if there was some confirmation that it works on Linux as well (and I guess Windows too).
